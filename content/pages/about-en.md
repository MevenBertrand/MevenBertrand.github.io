Post-doctoral researcher in computer science, in the [CLASH](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/clash/) group at the University of Cambrige.

Before that, PhD candidate at Inria/University of Nantes in the [Gallinette team](http://gallinette.inria.fr/), under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](http://tabareau.fr).
Even before that, studied at [computer science department of the ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/).

My main interests are type theory and proofs assistants, in particular [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).
I am also quite fond of everything revolving around bidirectional typing.
One of the things I try and work towards is bridging the gap between complex, real-life implementations of proof assistants
and their theoretic specifications, in particular in the framework of the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/) project.
