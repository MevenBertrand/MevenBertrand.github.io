Post-doctoral researcher in computer science, in the [CLASH](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/clash/) group at the University of Cambrige.

Before that, PhD student in the Inria/University of Nantes [Gallinette team](http://gallinette.inria.fr/), under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](http://tabareau.fr).
Even before that, student in the [computer science department of the ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/), and for a year in the [Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science master](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/master/master-computing-science/specialisation-mfocs-0/) of the Radboud University Nijmegen.

I work mainly around proof assistants, chiefly those based on type theory, and in particular [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).
I am also fond of type theory in general, and especially of bidirectional typing.
I mainly try to bridge the gap between complex, real-life implementations of proof assistants
and their theoretic specifications, in particular in the framework of the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/) project.
