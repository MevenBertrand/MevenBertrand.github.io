PhD student in computer science since 2019, under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](http://tabareau.fr), in the Inria/University of Nantes [Gallinette team](http://gallinette.inria.fr/).

Before that, student in the [computer science department of the ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/), and for a year in the [Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science master](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/master/master-computing-science/specialisation-mfocs-0/) of the Radboud University Nijmegen.

My main interest lies in proofs assistants, particularly those based on type theory. I am also fond of bidirectional typing, especially as a tool to understand and specify real-world implementations of proof assistants. To this aim, I participate to the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/) project.
