I am a second year PhD student in computer science, under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](http://tabareau.fr). I work in the [Gallinette team](http://gallinette.inria.fr/) of the University of Nantes.
Before that I was a student in the [computer science department of the ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/), and spent a year in the [Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science master](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/master/master-computing-science/specialisation-mfocs-0/) of the Radboud University Nijmegen.

I am mainly interested in how mathematics are, could or should be done. In particular, I have a strong belief that proof assistants have something to bring to those questions. I thus try and investigate those both under foundational aspects (I am especially fond of the type theoretic approach to logics), and practical ones (how to do actual maths).
