Second year PhD student in computer science, under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](http://tabareau.fr), in the Inria/University of Nantes [Gallinette team](http://gallinette.inria.fr/).

Before that, student in the [computer science department of the ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI/), and for a year in the [Mathematical Foundation of Computer Science master](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/master/master-computing-science/specialisation-mfocs-0/) of the Radboud University Nijmegen.

My main interest is how mathematics are or could be practised. In particular, I strongly believe that proof assistants have something to bring to those questions, and I am particularly fond of the type theoretic approach to logics. I currently work in the world of the Coq proof assistant and of the Calculus of Constructions.
