During my second year of master we taught with [RÃ©my Cerda](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/remy.cerda/)
a weekly, semester-long, category theory seminar/introduction course.
It was designed for fellow mathematics and computer science students of the ENS de Lyon,
as this topic was not taught as such, although it was necessary for a significant portion of master courses.

Our main source was the [book by Steve Awodey](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/category-theory-9780199237180?cc=fr&lang=en&),
and we covered most basic categorical concepts.

We are still working on the course notes, hoping to one day turn them into a full-fledged book on the subject in French.
