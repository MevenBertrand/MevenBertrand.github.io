In 2016, I was an intern for 2 months with [Hugo Herbelin](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~herbelin/).
We worked on an algorithm to compile complex, dependent pattern-matching without using the axiom K, following ideas
around [small inversion](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00489412/en/).
It did not make it to any kind of publication for now.
