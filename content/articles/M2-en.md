I spent the spring semester 2019 as an intern under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](https://tabareau.fr/).
We worked with [Éric Tanter](https://pleiad.cl/people/etanter) on applying the gradual typing approach to the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
Although the internship led to a thesis and defense, those are outdated – see the [POPL '21 paper](publications) instead.
