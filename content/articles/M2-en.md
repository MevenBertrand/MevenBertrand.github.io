For my masters thesis I worked as an intern under the supervision of [Nicolas Tabareau](https://tabareau.fr/).
We collaborated with [Ã‰ric Tanter](https://pleiad.cl/people/etanter) on applying the gradual typing approach to the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
Although the internship led to a thesis and defence, those are outdated, see the [corresponding publication](publications) instead.
