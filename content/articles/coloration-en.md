I really like to tell the story of the four colors theorem. I did it multiple times,
with various durations (from 5 min to 1h30) and publics (students, researchers, "amateurs").
I was mostly using a board, so no traces remain, but one on those instances was filmed as part
of the [5 minutes Lebesgue](https://www.lebesgue.fr/fr/content/5min-about).
