I take part in the 
[Chantiers Arts, Technologies et Sciences](https://www.athenor.com/residences-projets-de-territoire-creations/2019-2020/musique-et-mathematiques),
with researcher Bertrand Michel, theatre authors Sylvain Renard and Rémi Chechetto, and technical high school classes and teachers.
The project should have borne fruits during the 2020 spring, but has been postponed to 2020-2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemics.
