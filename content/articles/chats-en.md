I took part to the 
[Chantiers Arts, Technologies et Sciences](https://www.athenor.com/residences-projets-de-territoire-creations/2019-2020/musique-et-mathematiques),
with researcher Bertrand Michel, theatre authors Sylvain Renard and Rémi Chechetto, and technical high school classes and teachers.
The project should originally have borne fruits during the 2020 spring, but due to the Covid pandemic it has been extended, and eventually lasted
for three full years. It culminated with an exposition, organized by students in June 2022, where they presented the result of these three years
of collaboration.
