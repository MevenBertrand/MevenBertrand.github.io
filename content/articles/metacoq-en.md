A project formalizing Coq in Coq and providing tools for manipulating Coq terms and developing certified plugins (i.e. translations, compilers or tactics) in Coq.

I contributed mostly on the theory part, more specifically to the proof of completeness of the type-checker that is implemented as part of the project,
through an equivalence between the specification and a bidirectional type system reflecting the implementation.
