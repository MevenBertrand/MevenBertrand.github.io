A project to show decidability of type-checking for a dependently-typed language, featuring all representative features of Martin-Löf Type Theory. Logical relation setup heavily inspired by [a previous similar project in Agda](https://github.com/mr-ohman/logrel-mltt/).

Started as Arthur's internship subject. I took over at the end of it
and developed a large part of the project, especially the later algorithmic parts and decision algorithm. Kenji and Loïc contributed too, mainly around the logical relation.
